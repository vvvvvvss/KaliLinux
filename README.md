# KaliLinux

Kali Linux is a Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. 
It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security. 
The software is based on the Debian Testing branch: most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian repositories.   
Penetration testing, often referred to as pen testing, is a critical practice in the field of cybersecurity. 
It involves simulating cyber-attacks on a system, network, or web application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. 
This proactive approach allows organizations to strengthen their defenses before an actual attack occurs. 
To conduct effective penetration testing, security professionals rely on specialized tools and platforms designed for this purpose. 
One of the most renowned platforms in this domain is Kali Linux, a Debian-based distribution tailored specifically for penetration testing and security auditing.  
  
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely access remote machines over a network. 
It encrypts data sent between the client and server, providing a secure way to manage servers, transfer files, or execute commands remotely. 
The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network. 
SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices.
